**Visual Insights:** Includes a Correlation Heatmap, Neighborhood Price Distribution (Box Plot), and a "Sweet Spot" Scatter 

**Installation & Usage**

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.x, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Execution:** Open Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

**The "Sweet Spot":** High-quality stays are most consistently found in the 700–1,500 INR price range.

**Top Area:** The central Manali neighborhood offers the highest density of budget-friendly, high-rated options compared to surrounding areas.
