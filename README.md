# **Manali Airbnb Budget Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes a dataset of 12,000+ Airbnb listings in Manali to identify the best budget-friendly stays (under 5,000 INR). By using custom metrics like a Refined Value Score, the analysis identifies properties that offer the highest quality relative to their price.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted guest counts from text data and created binary flags for key amenities like Mountain Views and Wifi.

3. **Visual Insights:** Includes a Correlation Heatmap, Neighborhood Price Distribution (Box Plot), and a "Sweet Spot" Scatter 

## **Installation & Usage**

1. **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

2. **Execution:** Open Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3.**Data Source:** The analysis uses a scraped dataset of Manali Airbnb listings.

## **Final Results**

1. **The "Sweet Spot":** High-quality stays are most consistently found in the 700–1,500 INR price range.

2. **Top Area:** The central Manali neighborhood offers the highest density of budget-friendly, high-rated options compared to surrounding areas.

## **Why this is important for your project:**

1. **Professionalism:** It shows you can document your work for a technical audience.

2. **Accessibility:** Someone can understand your results without having to run your code or read through every cell.

3. **Portfolio Ready:** If you upload this to GitHub, the README will be the first thing recruiters or collaborators see.
